			<p class="col-md-6" style="color: black;">In the 1920's the Politics were kind of sketchy. There were a lot of scandals involving the President. There was also a lot of political outrage. The political instability during Hardings presidency was stupendous and then when Coolidge was president, everything kind of corrected but was still not so good.</p>

			<p class="col-md-6" style="color: black;">In the 1960's the politics were absolutely crazy. There was a lot wrong with international relations. We had problems like Cuban Missle crisis and the Bay of Pigs and the Berlin wall and so on and so forth. THey were bad but we also got one of the greatest presidents america knows. We had Kennedy. He was a charismatic and caring guy. America was very bipolar as far as politics go.</p>

			<h3>Comparison</h3>
			<p class="col-md-push-2" style="color: black;">The politics in the 20's and the 60's are amazing and sketchy and crazy and a lot of different extreme forms of exageration. For example, in the 20's there was a massive scandal in the cabinet of the current president, President Harding. This created a lot of political unrest within the governmental system and the sociatal standpoit on the issues. This is also seen in the 60's. We see that JFK, a celebrity president, is elected. This was during the height of the cold war. This was also creating political unrest. This is where we see the creation of the Washington-Kremlin hotline. But the differences are... in the 20's, it was relatvely normal as far as everythin else goes. But in the 60's we see assassinations and we see assassins being murdered and we see multiple elections in which presidents win by a landslide.</p>
