				<h3>Comparison</h3>
				<p class="col-md-push-2" style="color:black;">The culture of both decades were kind of similar. They were both impactful on the future of the US. The celebrity impact in both decades were very large. The first was the creation of celebrities and how they affect america. They gave way to the idea of the idolization of people and celebrities. Then you see that the celebrities of the 60's were the president and everyone idolized them. They were the "Royalty of America". There were a lot of different things that happened that changed the ideas released on the rest of time. Things like the idea of assassination. Or the living room war. Or the death of massive celebrities.</p>
