			<p style="color: black;" class="col-md-6"> The economics of the 1920's were very large. The amounts that America was spending, owning and earning were massive. The beginning of the 20's, the US owned 40% of the worlds wealth. The US also instituted and realeased the dawes plan for europe. Laissez Faire economics was introduced and widely used and accepted. And the consumer entertainment industry mad $4.5 billion on entertainment.</p>

			<p style="color: black;" class="col-md-6"> The economics of the 1960's were kind of uneventful compared to the 20's. The only big thing was the creation of medicaid and medicare. This was mainly because of the cold war kind of mindset happening. It was a lot of very slow and scared living. This affected the economy very largely impart of the fact that everyone didn't know what was going on. This affected money flow and thus the economy was mostly stagnant. This is what the economy of the 60's will do to the long term effects of the US.</p>

				<h3>Comparison</h3>
				<p class="col-md-push-2" style="color:black;">There wasn't a ton of similarities between the 20's and the 60's. The closest there is to similarity is the drastic measures or amounts in both the decades. In the 20's there were major measures taken. And there was a very big ownage of wealth in America. And in the 60's there were massive tax cuts proposed. There was also the massive creation of medicaid and medicare. But in the 20's we saw that there was mass influx of money into the govt. and economy. But in the 60's we saw a mass exodus and or stagninant flow of money in the economy and govt.</p>
